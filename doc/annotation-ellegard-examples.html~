<h3>Parsed examples from Elleg&aring;rd 1953</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>

In his thesis on the rise of DO support in the history of English,
Elleg&aring;rd 1953 published a list of the textual sources for the
examples that the figures and tables in the thesis were based on.  These
examples were located and entered as raw text by Ann Taylor (ADT) and
later parsed by Beatrice Santorini (BES).  The resulting file consists
of roughly 325,000 words (excluding punctuation and metadata).  Details
concerning the data are available in Elleg&aring;rd's thesis.

<h4>One-to-one correspondence between Elleg&aring;rd examples and parsed tokens</h4>

In the file produced by Taylor, each Elleg&aring;rd example stood in
one-to-one correspondence with a coding string.  In entering
Elleg&aring;rd's examples, Taylor naturally respected orthographical
conventions concerning sentence-final punctuation.  However, these
conventions are not always consistent with the
<a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/ppche/ppche-release-2016/annotation"
target="_new">guidelines for the annotation of historical English</a>
concerning sentence tokenization.  In order to maintain one-to-one
correspondence between Elleg&aring;rd examples and parsed tokens, the
annotation guidelines are therefore relaxed in the following way.  Each
Elleg&aring;rd example in the parsed file is dominated by a node labeled
ROOT, which may dominate more than one matrix clause (IP-MAT,
CP-QUE-MAT, etc.) as needed, potentialy violating the syntactic
annotation guidelines.  Below this ROOT level, the guidelines apply in
full force.

<h4>CP/IP vs. cp/ip</h4>

<p>
Independently of the tokenization issue, parsing the examples of course
often breaks up syntactically complex examples into matrix and
subordinate clauses.  In cases where a single textual witness contains
multiple instances of the DO variable, the witness is repeated (just as
it is in Elleg&aring;rd's appendix).  In order to maintain the
one-to-one-correspondence between Elleg&aring;rd's examples and the
parsed examples, we use lowercase clausal labels (cp, ip) for clauses in
the example that are not associated with Ellegard's current entry.  For
example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (ROOT (CP-QUE-MAT (coding text-id:text-code:year:page-and-line)	&larr; copy 1 focuses on DO variable in higher CP
        (IP-SUB (DOD did)
                (NP-SBJ (PRO He))
			    (VBD complain)
			    (CP-THT (C that)
				    (ip-SUB (NP-SBJ (PRO they))         &larr; lower ip not in focus
					    (VBD worked)
					    (NEG not)
					    (ADVP (ADV carefully))))))
	(. ?))
  (ID id-for-copy-1))

( (ROOT (cp-QUE-MAT (ip-SUB (DOD did) 			                                      &larr; higher cp/ip not in focus
			    (NP-SBJ (PRO He))
			    (VBD complain)
			    (CP-THT (C that)
				    (IP-SUB (coding text-id:text-code:year:page-and-line)     &larr; copy 2 focuses on DO variable in lower IP
                                            (NP-SBJ (PRO they))
					    (VBD worked)
					    (NEG not)
					    (ADVP (ADV carefully))))))
	(. ?))
  (ID different-id-for-copy-2))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>Source information</h4>

<p>
As shown in the example above, source information is associated with the
relevant CP or IP in a clause-initial SRC node.

<ul>
<li>column 1: Ellegard's text identifier
<li>column 2: Ellegard's text code
<li>column 3: year
<li>column 4: page and line number, along with supplementary information where called for:
    <ul>
    <li>duplicate - Elleg&aring;rd erroneously repeats a clause under
        two separate categories (for instance, a negative declarative
        might also be listed as a negative imperative).  The erroneous
        token is flagged as duplicate.
    <li>ppcme2, ppceme, pceec - the example also appears in a subcorpus
        of the the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/
        target="_new"">Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English</a>.
    <!--<li>ell - I have forgotten what this stands for, but it does not seem
        important!-->
    </ul>
</ul>

<a name="annotation">
<h4>Annotation guidelines</h4>

In general, the database is parsed in accordance with
the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/ppche/ppche-release-2016/annotation"
target="_new">annotation manual for historical English</a>, with the
following exceptions:

<ul>
<li>For the reasons just discussed, the guidelines for sentence
    tokenization have been relaxed because of the character of the data
    as a collection of examples rather than a corpus of running text.
<li>The guidelines have been slightly simplified in the following
    respects, none of which affect the annotation of basic clause
    structure.
<ul>
<li>Participles functioning as adjectives (whether prenominal or
    predicative) are tagged as ADJ.
<li>For uniformity, traces of extraposed degree complements are treated
    in the same way as their counterparts in comparative complements.
<li>"Plus tags" (like ADJ+N) are generally replaced by the corresponding
    simple tag for the head of the word.  In some cases ("thereon" and
    the like), this is not easily possible, and plus tags (ADV+P)
    continue to be used.
</ul>

</ul>

<a name="lemmatization">
<h4>Lemmatization</h4>

As is well known, Elleg&aring;rd identified a class of verbs that behave
conservatively with respect to DO support, which he called the KNOW
class.  The main members are given on p. 199 of the thesis, and in
the appendix, he adds two more.

<ul>
<li>boot
<li>care
<li>do (main verb, from appendix)
<li>doubt
<li>dread (from appendix)
<li>fear
<li>know
<li>list
<li>mistake
<li>skill
<li>trow
<li>wot (never with DO support)
</ul>

<p>
For convenience, these verbs have been lemmatized in clauses
instantiating the DO variable by appending the lemma to the verb form
with an equal sign (as in IcePaHC).  For example:

<ul>
<li>Careth=care
<li>doughte=doubt
<li>lik'st=like
</ul>
